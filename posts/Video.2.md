 Transcript:

The camera starts with a panoramic shot of the thick and mysterious woods. LEO FOSTER and LENA FOSTER, both 13-year-old twins, stand side by side, determined to help their friend Austen find his missing sister, Lydia.

LENA:
(anxious)
Leo, this is scary. We have no idea where Austen and Lydia went.

LEO:
(nods)
I know, Lena. But we can't give up. We promised we'd help Austen find his sister.

LENA:
(frustrated)
I wish we had some clue about where they went. It's like they vanished.

LEO:
(trying to stay positive)
Maybe we should split up and cover more ground. We need to find them before it gets dark.

LENA:
(uncertain)
But what if we get lost too? This forest is huge, and I don't know my way around.

LEO:
(reassuring)
We'll be careful, Lena. Let's leave markers on the trees so we can find our way back. And if we don't find them soon, we'll head back and tell our parents or the authorities.

They decide to split up, and the camera follows Lena as she searches through the dense undergrowth.

LENA:
(calling out)
Austen! Lydia! Where are you?

She receives no response, only the rustling of leaves in the wind.

LENA:
(voice breaking)
This is hopeless. We're never going to find them.

Seemingly 2 hours after LENA and LEO split.

LENA:
(teary-eyed)
Austen, Lydia, please be okay.
