 Transcript:

The camera starts with a panoramic shot of ***** woods. LEO FOSTER and LENA FOSTER, both 13-year-old twins, stand side by side, They were helping AUSTEN QUEN find his missing sister, LYDIA QUEN.

LENA:
(anxious)
Leo, this is scary. We have no idea where Austen and Lydia went.

LEO:
(nods)
I know, Lena. But we can't give up. We promised we'd help Austen find his sister.

LENA:
(frustrated)
I wish we had some clue about where they went. It's like they vanished.

LEO:
(trying to stay positive)
Maybe we should split up and cover more ground. We need to find them before it gets dark.

LENA:
(uncertain)
But what if we get lost too? This forest is huge, and I don't know my way around.

LEO:
(reassuring)
We'll be careful, Lena. Let's leave markers on the trees so we can find our way back. And if we don't find them soon, we'll head back and tell our parents or the authorities.

They decide to split up, and the camera follows Lena as she searches through the dense undergrowth. The camera switches to LEO FOSTER, who's also struggling to find any sign of AUSTEN QUEN AND LYDIA QUEN.

LEO:
(calling out)
Guys! Please, answer if you can hear me!

Silence fills the woods, and Leo's frustration grows.

LEO:
(whispering to himself)
Come on, Austen, where are you?

As Leo moves deeper into the woods, he becomes more disoriented, and his surroundings start to look unfamiliar.

LEO:
(panicking)
I don't know where I am. Lena! Lena!

Leo's voice echoes through the trees, but Lena is too far away to hear him.

LEO:
(voice trembling)
I should've stayed with Lena. Now I'm lost too.
