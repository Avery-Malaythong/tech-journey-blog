 Transcript:

The camera opens to a pitch-black scene, and heavy breathing can be heard. As the darkness gradually lifts, the audience sees AUSTEN QUEN, the 13-year-old with long brown hair and brown eyes, huddled in a dark corner. The camera shakes as Austen holds it, recording themselves, trying to remain quiet.

AUSTEN:
(whispers, voice trembling)
I don't know what's out there, but it's hunting me. I have to stay quiet and hide.

Austen's face is illuminated by the dim light from the camera. Fear and panic are evident in their eyes.

AUSTEN:
(whispers)
I was searching for Lydia, and then I heard something. It sounded like footsteps, but... not human.

A rustling sound can be heard in the distance, making Austen flinch.

AUSTEN:
(whispers)
Did you hear that? It's close. I don't know what to do.

Austen takes a deep breath, trying to steady their nerves.

AUSTEN:
(whispers)
I'm scared, but I need to keep recording. Maybe it'll help someone find me if I... if I don't make it out.

Another rustling sound, much closer this time, causes Austen to press further into the corner.

AUSTEN:
(whispers, voice shaking)
I have to stay quiet. I have to stay hidden.

The camera captures the darkness around Austen, only faintly revealing the outline of the room or space they are in.

AUSTEN:
(whispers)
I can't see much, but I don't think I'm alone in here.

A low growl echoes through the room, sending shivers down Austen's spine.

AUSTEN:
(whispers, fear evident)
Oh no, oh no. Please, whoever is watching this, if you find this recording, help me. I don't know what's after me, but it's not human. It's... something else.

Austen's breathing quickens, and the camera shakes more intensely.

AUSTEN:
(whispers, almost inaudible)
I can't stay here. I have to move.

Austen slowly starts to inch away from the corner, trying to remain as silent as possible. The camera pans around, revealing glimpses of the eerie surroundings.

AUSTEN:
(whispers)
I'm going to try to get out of here. If I make it, I'll leave markers so someone can follow my path. If you find this recording, please find me.

Austen begins to move cautiously, but suddenly, a loud noise interrupts their movement. The camera jerks, capturing a fleeting glimpse of a dark, menacing figure before the recording abruptly ends.
